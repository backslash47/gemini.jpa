This milestone provides you with access to the EclipseLink JPA 2.0 provider. The EclipseLink 2.1.1,
or later, bundles (or milestones toward the release) must be used.

For an example of how to access an EntityManager from an OSGi program run the sample program.
To do this, install and start the bundles described in "Getting Started.txt" included in this 
distribution. Additionally, install the org.eclipse.gemini.jpa.samples bundle.
